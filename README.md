# Hello! Welcome to My GitHub 🎉

## Who Am I? 👩‍💻
I’m Victoria, a passionate web developer on a journey to create cool and efficient digital solutions. 
My background is a bit unique – I originally studied radiophysics, where I fell in love with coding (yes, Python, C, C++). 
Now, I’m diving deep into web development, and I’m loving every bit of it!

## My Journey 🌱
I’m currently enrolled in the Fullstack Web Development course at **Wild Code School**, where I work on real-world projects to sharpen my skills. 
Before this, I had a strong foundation in programming, thanks to my studies in radiophysics, which led me to explore web development.

## Cool Stuff I’ve Built 🚀
Here are some of my projects that I’m pretty proud of:

- **[Externatech](https://github.com/Victoria-31/Externatech)** – A developer recruitment platform with a sleek company dashboard.
  A Full Stack application similar to Pôle Emploi with React, Express, MySQL, JWT authentication, upload management, route protection, user input validation, API creation, and integration testing.
- **[Geography Quiz](https://victoria-31.github.io/QuizGeo)** – Developed an interactive geography quiz with dynamically generated questions from a REST API. (Technologies used: React, TypeScript, REST API, CSS3).
  Get your geography knowledge tested!
- **[Cookie Clicker Game](https://victoria-31.github.io/Projet1)** – A fun, interactive game where you click to earn cookies.
  It’s a perfect intro to coding! (Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript)
- ** [Plantéo](https://github.com/Victoria-31/planteo) Plantéo is a plant management application with a back-end, featuring JWT authentication for secure user access.
